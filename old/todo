entry argument for wmake, wmaketest, wrun, and wruntest
does nothing
we need a way to automate removing the main function and
making the entry method named main
maybe tests should not be allowed to have main and programs
have to have main and then we auto add main to the test when
building

organize all the code

currently it seems to rebuild all the .o files if one fails
because its comparing the cpps against the .exe when the
cpps should be compared against their .o files

make whelp more detailed
write that the path to each library dll needs to be added
to the system environment variables in order to build and run
stuff using those dlls

a rebuild should trigger if there has been a change in the
config file
